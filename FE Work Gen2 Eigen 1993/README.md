This Finite Element source code is dated 1991-1993 . ie my early post-doc days.
It was my reqworking of my Ph.D software to make it evelove into a more general purpose framework.
ie. moving from just analysing SLope Stability problems to being used to analyse Spud-cans and Piles and later eigenmodes.
