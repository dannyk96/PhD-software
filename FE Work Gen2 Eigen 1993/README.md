This Finite Element source code is dated 1991-1993 . ie my early post-doc days.
It was my reqworking of my Ph.D software to make it evelove into a more general purpose framework.
ie. moving from just analysing SLope Stability problems to being used to analyse Spud-cans and Piles and later eigenmodes.

## Notes
  * The Fortran source, although generic has some embedded compiler hints for the Salford Fortran Compiler for MS-DOS.
  * The original filenames were all upercase with the .FOR extension. These renamed here in a lowercase and with .f extensions
  * This is Fortan77 not Fortran90 so is fixed format. It does though use every more modern Fortran features that compilers alow, eg lowercase names, and no lomit of 6 characters.
